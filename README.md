The translator is available at [tdtranslator.herokuapp.com](https://tdtranslator.herokuapp.com/)\
This project was developed by the English-only group of [Tomorrowdevs](https://www.tomorrowdevs.com/)
in live coding on Monday nights.

### Core Translation Feature
Translations are generated through [*googletrans*](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/) Python library. 

### Launch locally:
Two steps:
`pip install -r requirements.txt` (only once)
`python manage.py runserver`
